# Project Description

This project was developed as part of a technical assessment for a Full Stack Developer position, with a primary focus on backend development for a bakery shop case study. The application is built using Golang as the backend programming language and PostgreSQL as the relational database system.

The system is designed with scalability and maintainability in mind, adhering to Clean Architecture principles and RESTful API standards. This ensures a well-structured, modular codebase that is easy to maintain and extend in the future.
